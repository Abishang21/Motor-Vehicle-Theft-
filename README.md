# Motor-Vehicle-Theft-Analysis

**Project Background**

The New Zealand Police, operating in the public safety and law enforcement sector for over 150 years, is committed to enhancing community safety and reducing crime nationwide. 

With a wealth of data on motor vehicle theft collected over a six-month period, this project aims to extract valuable insights from the department's vehicle theft database to support and strengthen their crime prevention strategies.

The insights and recommendations in this project are provided in the following key areas:

  i. **Vehicle Theft Trends**: When and where vehicles are most commonly stolen.
  
  ii. **Vehicle Type Analysis**: The types of vehicles most frequently stolen.
  
  iii. **Geographical Patterns**: Regions with the highest and lowest theft rates.
  
  iv. **Vehicle Age Insights**: The average age of stolen vehicles and how it varies by type.

**Data Structure & Initial Checks**

The police database structure as seen below consists of three tables: Make, Stolen_Vehicles, and Locations, with a total row count of 4,707 records.

Prior to beginning the analysis, a variety of checks were conducted for quality control and to familiarise myself with the dataset. Used Power BI to performed initial data inspections, including checks for data types, summary statistics, and any anomalies within the records. These checks ensured the data was clean and ready for analysis, allowing for accurate insights into vehicle theft patterns.

**Executive Summary**

**Overview of Finding**

Notably, Auckland experiences the highest incidence of vehicle thefts, followed closely by Canterbury. In terms of vehicle types, sedans and hatchbacks are the most frequently stolen across all areas. The average age of stolen vehicles is 23 years, indicating that older models are likely easier targets due to less sophisticated security systems. Additionally, thefts tend to peak on specific days of the week, with Monday recording the highest number of incidents.

**Weekday Theft Trends**

The analysis of thefts by weekday highlights a peak in vehicle thefts on Monday, with 83 thefts recorded on the highest day in April 2022. This indicates that the beginning of the week poses a greater risk for vehicle owners, possibly due to increased activity or reduced vigilance after the weekend. The trend reveals that while thefts are relatively steady throughout the week, certain weekdays, particularly Monday and Tuesday, show heightened activity.

Mondays represent a peak risk for vehicle thefts, with a 12% increase in incidents compared to the midweek average.

Over the past year, Mondays have consistently reported higher theft numbers, a pattern that has emerged across several months.

**Regional Theft Patterns**

Theft activity across various regions reveals significant hotspots. Auckland emerges as the region with the highest number of vehicle thefts, with 1,638 reported cases. This accounts for a large proportion of total vehicle thefts, indicating a key area for targeted interventions such as increased patrols or public awareness campaigns. Following Auckland, Canterbury recorded 660 thefts, making it the second-highest region for vehicle theft. These insights suggest a strong correlation between urban density and theft frequency, potentially influenced by factors like population size and vehicle accessibility in these areas.

Auckland and Canterbury are critical regions for theft-prevention strategies, accounting for over 40% of the total vehicle thefts across all regions.

Urban areas with larger populations have shown a consistent trend of higher theft incidences due to increased vehicle presence and access, with Auckland continually leading in the number of reported cases.

**Recommendations**

Based on the insights gathered from the motor vehicle theft analysis, the following actionable recommendations are provided to help law enforcement and policymakers mitigate vehicle theft incidents;

  i. Auckland and Canterbury, with the highest vehicle theft rates, should receive additional law enforcement attention. Increasing patrols, installing more security cameras, and establishing neighborhood watch programs in these areas can help deter theft.
  
  ii. Sedans and hatchbacks, particularly older models, are most frequently stolen. Public awareness campaigns should be launched to inform owners of these vehicle types about theft prevention tactics, such as steering wheel locks and alarms. Offering incentives for upgrading to vehicles with modern security features could also be beneficial.
  
  iii. Mondays and Fridays see the highest number of thefts. Law enforcement should adjust their patrol schedules to increase visibility on these days. Special operations targeting high-theft areas during peak hours (evening/nighttime) would be particularly effective.
  
  iv. The analysis shows that older vehicles are prime targets due to their lack of sophisticated security features. Introducing programs that provide subsidies or tax breaks for upgrading security systems (such as GPS tracking devices or immobilizers) could reduce theft rates.
  
  v. Work closely with community organizations to raise awareness about the vulnerabilities of certain vehicle types. Community-driven initiatives, such as neighborhood watch programs and educational workshops on vehicle theft prevention, can significantly reduce the number of thefts.
  
  vi. Inform vehicle owners, especially in high-theft regions, about the importance of securing their vehicles. Campaigns should emphasize simple measures such as locking doors, not leaving valuables in sight, and parking in well-lit areas.
  
  vii. Police resources should be dynamically allocated based on theft data, focusing on days and areas with higher theft incidents. Implementing a data-driven approach for resource deployment can maximize efficiency and reduce the overall theft rate.
