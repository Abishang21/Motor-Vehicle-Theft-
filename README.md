# Motor-Vehicle-Theft-Analysis

**Project Background**

The New Zealand Police, operating in the public safety and law enforcement sector for over 150 years, is committed to enhancing community safety and reducing crime nationwide. 

With a wealth of data on motor vehicle theft collected over a six-month period, this project aims to extract valuable insights from the department's vehicle theft database to support and strengthen their crime prevention strategies.

The insights and recommendations in this project are provided in the following key areas:

  i. **Vehicle Theft Trends**: When and where vehicles are most commonly stolen.
  
  ii. **Vehicle Type Analysis**: The types of vehicles most frequently stolen.
  
  iii. **Geographical Patterns**: Regions with the highest and lowest theft rates.
  
  iv. **Vehicle Age Insights**: The average age of stolen vehicles and how it varies by type.

Prior to beginning the analysis, a variety of checks were conducted for quality control and to familiarise myself with the dataset. Used Power BI to performed initial data inspections, including checks for data types, summary statistics, and any anomalies within the records. These checks ensured the data was clean and ready for analysis, allowing for accurate insights into vehicle theft patterns.

**Executive Summary**

**Overview of Finding**

Notably, Auckland experiences the highest incidence of vehicle thefts, followed closely by Canterbury. In terms of vehicle types, sedans and hatchbacks are the most frequently stolen across all areas. The average age of stolen vehicles is 23 years, indicating that older models are likely easier targets due to less sophisticated security systems. Additionally, thefts tend to peak on specific days of the week, with Monday recording the highest number of incidents.
