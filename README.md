# Motor-Vehicle-Theft-Analysis

Project Background

The New Zealand Police, operating in the public safety and law enforcement sector for over 150 years, is committed to enhancing community safety and reducing crime nationwide. 

With a wealth of data on motor vehicle theft collected over a six-month period, this project aims to extract valuable insights from the department's vehicle theft database to support and strengthen their crime prevention strategies.

The insights and recommendations in this project are provided in the following key areas:

  i. Vehicle Theft Trends: When and where vehicles are most commonly stolen.
  
  ii. Vehicle Type Analysis: The types of vehicles most frequently stolen.
  
  iii. Geographical Patterns: Regions with the highest and lowest theft rates.
  
  iv. Vehicle Age Insights: The average age of stolen vehicles and how it varies by type.
